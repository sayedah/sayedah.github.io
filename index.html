        </div>
        <p>Hello! I'm Sayeda, a Computer Science student from York University. I'll be graduating in December 2022, and I am currently working on specializing in Front-End Development.</p> 
        <p>Besides Java and C which were taught in school, I am self-taught in all the other languages and tools listed in my resume. I enjoy HTML/CSS/JS the most, and am at the moment 
          utilizing them to create as many projects as I can, which can be found on my GitHub.</p>
        <p>I've always had an aspiration for teaching, so I decided to start up a tutoring business on the side, and host classes on Skype for any youth that have a passion 
          for coding and software development. I mainly touch on Java and Python, but for those who express interest, I also divuldge in web development, UML, and C.</p>
        <p>My personal interests include baking and blogging my recipes. At the moment I, along with a back-end developer friend, are creating a website for myself where I can post my bakes. 
          I am also working on becoming proficient in React and Angular. Other hobbies include hiking, tennis, playing with my cat, and learning new languages along with their functionalities.</p>
        <p>I love to stay busy, and always strive to push myself above and beyond. I am very meticulous which can be a weakness but I always play it to my 
          strengths the best I can. I enjoy collaborating in groups and learning from my team members, and stay committed to the company and my projects.</p>

        <h4><u>Private Tutor (Current)</u></h4>
        <p>Currently I am teaching classes 2 times a week for students in Grades 9-12, intrigued in the world of software development
          I assist any senior students taking coding classes with their projects and prepare them for their tests/exams, and I create mini assignments 
          for the tutees, along with instructional powerpoints. One class lasts for 4 months, divided based
          on student's skill levels, and together we go through the basics of Java, Python, and divuldge into web development. </p>
          <p></p>

        <h4><u>Design Intern at Fuzzbuzz</u></h4>
        <p>I was introduced to the start-up Fuzzbuzz through fellow peers when I was a student at Waterloo. 
          Fuzzbuzz made its name for developing a fuzzing software to continually test code for any vulnerabilities, performing thousands of tests in a second. 
          During my time there, I worked with the Head of Design to style their webpage, and designed how their product would appear to users. 
          I picked up a passion for UI/UX development here, and attempted to teach myself enough 
          front-end to be able to go one step further and code out the designs with the software team. It was my first 
          experience working within a team, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am looking forward to collaborating in 
          more groups with members who share a passion for developing graphical user interfaces. 
        </p>

        <h4><u>Administrative Assistant at Hussain Software Consultants</u></h4>
        <p>When I first started working at a family business, I worked the job of an assistant, 
          and was responsible for setting up meetings, communicate to clients, receiving/sending emails, create and maintain
          a schedule, and ensure final goals were met with precision. When I joined the Computer Science program, I 
          taught myself Soap UI to be more involved on the technical aspects of the business, and became a tester for the rest of my
          time there. </p>
